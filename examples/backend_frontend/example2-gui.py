    This example shows how to use a Backend and a Frontend
    (an app WITH graphical user interface).

    The program uses a predefined application that scans the amplitude of a function
    generator and for each amplitude measures the trace in an oscilloscope
    (just random data in this simulated example).

    The User interface has two widgets connected to feats of the function generator
    (amplitude and frequency) and a few controls to control the scan.

# This particular backend has a function to scan the amplitude

# As arguments, you provide a Backend INSTANCE and a Frontend CLASS.
